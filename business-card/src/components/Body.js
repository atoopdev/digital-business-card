        <p>I love creating products that use technology to solve problems. To me, every problem is a fresh adventure and I really enjoy that. For the majority of my working career this has resulted in roles that emphasize providing technology solutions, business analysis, and working closely with users. I find bringing bringing order to chaos exciting!</p>

        <p>My current learning project focus is on web development/design. I am currently working on CSS, Javascript, and React. I really enjoy creating products that are easy to use, efficient, and (ideally) look aesthetically pleasing. Check out my portfolio web site to see some of my most recent projects.</p>
        <h2 className="interests-header">Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of technological interests I am an avid cook and Peloton devotee. On the weekends you would find me at a local museum or gallery, or trying a new restaurant in the International District.</p>
